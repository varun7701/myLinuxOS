Buglog MP3
---------------------------------------------------
Devel would not launch
        Solution: end up just switching test machines worked
Unable to compile due to having test machine open while making
        Solution: follow appendix G
Sudo make error 127 debug.sh could not execute
        Solution: run dos2unix ./debug.sh before making
Random characters when pressing two keys at once
        Solution: ASM linkage
When two keys pressed General Protection message
        Solution: ASM linkage
Never reached point to print key, keyboard interrupt not being raised 
        Solution: had to enable interrupts in kernel.c with sti()
Would not output more that one key
        Solution: due to while loop using keyboard status port
First key did not output key
        Solution: Got rid of while loop
test_interrupts not working, don't think RTC interrupt is ever being raised
        Solution: connect slave PIC to master PIC at irq line 2 in i8259_ini
Boot loop
        Solution: wrong constant B8000 paging.h, needed to align in paging.c
PG disabled 
        Solution: didn't have enable paging asm
Page directory giving wrong address when printed
        Solution: wrong constant B8000 paging.h, needed to align in paging.c

upper bound for kernel and video are getting page fault
        Solution: using int for the pointer which uses 4 bytes so the location bound went over the upper bound
        had to replace with char.


Checkpoint 2:


After terminal_write, cursor is jumping to random place on screen
        Solution: Clear keyboardbuffer after each terminal_read

One space at start of line on subsequent terminal_writes
        Solution: incorrect indexing for clearing keyboard buffer
                  reset buffer_index to -1 after reading

Backspace moving up to previous line on new terminal_read
        Solution: restrict backspace from getting into buffer at start of buffer

Random unknown character preceding files when printing directory
        Solution: got rid of line in putc deleting NULLs

RTC interrupt frequency test failing
        Solution: missed frequency in switch statement, added 256HZ

rtc_read() not working
        Solution: set interrupt flag in handler, set interrupt flag back to 0 outside of while loop

File system printing garbage values to screen
        Solution: initialized in kernel.c without passing in address argument, so added the address argument

Ran into a lot of pointer issues with the structs
        Solution: understanding when to use -> versus . versus *

Dentrys do not have the correct contents
        Solution: Filled dentrys as we added them to the stack, instead of adding unfilled dentrys


Checkpoint 3:


Page-Fault Exception while trying to execute shell
    Solution: system call handler was treating calls as zero-indexed instead of one-indexed
              fixed the indexing and changed call to jump table to account for the 0
              also set idt[0x80] to systemcall_asm handler

Once shell launches, keyboard input is not appearing on screen
    Solution: interrupts were not enabled during the syscalls
              sti() in syscall_read so interrupts are enabled during individual device calls

While trying to run testprint in the shell, returns "no command found"
    Solution: exe_name buffer being passed into read_dentry_by_name had extra garbage characters
              fill exe_name with nullchars before copying filename into it

Testprint prints correct message, but instantly page faults
    Solution: The return from halt wasn't returning to the correct location, needed to update the eax ret val


Checkpoint 4:

Boot loop crash when trying to add 6th shell (over max processes)
        Solution: when assigning PID in execute, we were giving the global pid value an invalid number
                 causing it to crash because it was trying to access invalid memory 
                 fixed by making new pid_loop variable 

"    cat verylongtextwithverylongname.tx" not running
        Solution: adjust argument and exe_name parsing to remove spaces at front of command

Multiple syserr tests failing
        Solution: bounds check in filesys and syscall
                  incorrect initializtion of ops_tables
                  when calling open, we now set flag back down to zero if read_dentry... fails

Any file_read was not working
        Solution: use fd_array inode instead of dentry in file_read
        
"cat verylongtextwithverylongname.txt" is runinng but it shouldn't
        Solution: add if statement in read_dentry_by_name to check if longer than 32


Checkpoint 5:

Page-Fault error when trying to write to save a terminal to backup video memory 
        Solution: Needed to initialize and set the pages to present in paging.C

Made our different terminals have separate text color so that it was easily distinguishable, but kept getting white text
        Solution: Needed to ensure that current terminal was only getting the color for its specific terminal by
                  by putting the video mem set line for all 3 terminals inside of if statements, rather than just for
                  terminals 2 and 3.

Not getting shell to execute on the terminal_swap call  
        Solution: We executed shell if the terminal was being called for the first time, which is when it first gets switched to

Could not get cursor location from lib.c 
        Solution: Had to create extern functions to get screen_x and screen_y for save/restore terminal helper functions

The cursor was not updating when we switched to a different terminal    
        Solution: Once we called assign_screen_x and assign_screen_y we needed to called update_cursor()

Memcpy for our save/restore helper functions threw errors 
        Solution: Needed to cast our video address to a uint8_t*
